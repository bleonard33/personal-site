    "I'm a social scientist by training and a software developer by accident. I currently work as a part of a small, agile development team within the Growth Lab of the Harvard Kennedy School. I completed a master's degree in government in May 2021 while working full-time at Harvard and hold a bachelor's degree in economics from UNC-Chapel Hill.",
    "Since the internship where I wrote my first lines of code, my career has been focused on developing interesting and unique data-driven tools. I have spent several years working in both startups and single-digit member Agile teams. I have had the opportunity to wear many hats across the lifecycle of software development and take the lead on developing full-scale software systems. I thrive off of being thrown into unfamiliar territory and coming up with solutions to challenging problems.",
    "Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, traveling, playing video games, learning how to create things, attempting to catch up on my massive backlog of unread books, and hiking with my rescue dog, Zeus."
